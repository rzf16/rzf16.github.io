title: About Me
---

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm Ryan Feng, a master's student in the [University of Michigan Robotics Institute](https://robotics.umich.edu/). My primary interests lie in motion planning, both for mobile robots and robotic manipulation tasks.

Outside of school, I'm a huge fan of NBA basketball and professional soccer, as well as an avid runner. Right now, I am...

:swimmer::bike::runner: (slowly) becoming a triathlete
:ski: trying out cross-country skiing
:book: reading [Uncivil Agreement by Lilliana Mason](https://www.amazon.com/Uncivil-Agreement-Politics-Became-Identity/dp/022652454X)
:musical_keyboard: learning [There Are Worse Games To Play](https://youtu.be/n_1zK8fslAA) and [War of Hearts](https://youtu.be/GX7f1Btk1yM) on the piano
