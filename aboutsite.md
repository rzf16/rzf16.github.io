title: About This Site
---

This site was made as a place to catalog my thoughts on a variety of topics. By putting them on a blog, I am forcing myself to develop and understand my own thoughts enough to communicate them clearly.

I hope to keep this site relatively non-technical for two reasons. First, I already have the need (through coursework, research, internships, etc.) to deeply understand and defend my opinions in my technical field. Second, and more importantly, I'd like to focus on topics which are relevant to a wider population with whom I can discuss my ideas.

Happy reading!
