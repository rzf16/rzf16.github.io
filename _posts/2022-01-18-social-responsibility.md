In 1970, Nobel prize-winning economise Milton Friedman published one of his most influential articles, [A Friedman Doctrine: The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits](https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html). This article was part of a larger trend in the early 1970s that saw the social responsibility of businesses erode in favor of profit. Although I haven't yet read the book myself, I've been recommended [Evil Geniuses: The Unmaking of America](https://www.amazon.com/Evil-Geniuses-Unmaking-America-History/dp/1984801341) for a detailed discussion on the topic.

Under this framework, ethical behavior becomes a secondary goal for business. Companies can exploit child labor in third-world countries, pay workers barely-living wages to toil away in dangerous conditions, or pollute the environment as they require (or sometimes, [all in one](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/18/how-the-race-for-cobalt-risks-turning-it-from-miracle-metal-to-deadly-chemical)), all in the name of profit.

Is that it then? Are we condemned to a future of profit over people and big business getting ever more powerful? I argue that we are not. In fact, I believe that we as consumers are the ones, not Milton Friedman or any other economist, who have the power to decide what the social responsibility of business ought to be.

## The Ultimatum Game
My line of thinking was largely inspired by a fascinating experiment known as the [Ultimatum Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimatum_game). In this experiment, there are two people: a *proposer* and a *responder*. The proposer is given $100 and proposes a way to split the money with the responder. If the responder accepts this proposal, the money is split accordingly. If the responder rejects, neither player receives any money.

From a pure game theory perspective, the strategy is clear: the proposer offers the responder only $1 of the $100. Then, it is in the responder's own interest to accept this extremely imbalanced proposal, as the alternative (rejecting) would result in receiving no money at all.

However, this is not what actually occurs when the scenario is played out by humans. Instead, proposers often offer $40-$50, while offers of less than $30 are mostly rejected. This result reveals an interesting aspect of human behavior: we are willing to sacrifice our own self-interest in order to punish perceived injustice. As a result, humans must make reasonably balanced offers to avoid punishment.

## Consumers as Responders
Big businesses, like proposers, offer a value proposition: we receive products that improve our (first-world) lives, while they receive money and our willful blindness regarding any unethical activities on their part. As consumers, we then play the role of the responder. Like in the Ultimatum Game, rejecting the proposal (refusing to buy their products) is usually against our own self-interest. Products we take for granted would become substantially more expensive or potentially not even exist.

This is where our power as consumers lies: as responders, we have the ability to punish companies by rejecting their proposals, albeit at some personal cost. Furthermore, we are able to decide *when* companies have gone too far and punish them accordingly. This is how we can dictate the social responsibility of companies: by drawing a line in the sand, we can force companies to accept certain social responsibilities or face the punishment.

## The Importance of Punishment
In a world without punishment, Friedman's idea will reign supreme. If consumers are indifferent to immoral behavior, the company most willing to use unethical methods to gain advantages and generate profits will no doubt outcompete a company working within ethical bounds. Let us illustrate this with a toy example.

SuperDuperSketchyCorp (SDSC) and SuperDuperEthicalCorp (SDEC) both make children's toys.

SDEC only sources raw materials in ways that minimize their environmental impact. They provide living wages and reasonable benefits packages for their employees. However, their toys must be priced at $20 per toy to support their noble pursuit of ethical behavior.

Meanwhile, SDSC operates SuperDuperSketchyMines which cause immense environmental damage. The raw materials are then transported to SuperDuperSketchyFactories, where low-paid child laborers work in dangerous conditions. By cutting all these corners, SDSC is able to sell their toys at $10.

If the consumer base acts purely in self-interest, SDSC will attract more customers by far. As such, SDEC is forced to either adopt some of SDSC's practices to cut costs or go out of business. Here, we see that following Friedman's strategy will clearly lead to better outcomes for the business (though perhaps not the society), and over time, this strategy will become dominant.

However, if the consumer base is willing to punish, the story is very different. Consumers can decide collectively that the value proposition made by SDSC is unethical and instead purchase from SDEC. SDSC then faces the same choice as SDEC in the previous scenario: either change its practices or go out of businesses.

## The Role of Media
Of course, a problem arises when the consumer is unaware of SDSC's behavior. In this case, even if the consumer is willing to punish, SDSC still attracts the majority of customers simply due to ignorance. This is absolutely **not** the fault of the consumer - everyday people living busy lives cannot be expected to perform extensive research on each company they buy from. This is the critical role of media: consumers need accurate, accessible, and easily understandable information to decide on accepting or rejecting the proposals made by businesses.

## The Line in the Sand
Knowing that we have this power, the natural question is when we should use it. At what point does the unethical behavior of a company outweigh the value it provides in the form of its products and technological advances? This is something that will vary heavily from person to person depending on their own moral compass. I do not feel comfortable telling anyone what their ethics should be, especially when I am by no means a perfectly ethical being. In fact, nobody is. But as long as we know the power we have as responders, we can always band together to draw a line in the sand, whenever it may be necessary.
