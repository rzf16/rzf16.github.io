Arguably the most famous question in philosophy is whether or not humans have free will. That is, do humans truly have the agency to make our own decisions, or is our perceived agency an illusion and our actions dictated by some superior being or by our biology?

There are many people much smarter than I discussing this problem. However, I argue that, while interesting, the result of this debate **should not matter**.

## Examining the possibilities
Free will either exists or it doesn't; there is no in-between. However, we as humans have no control over its existence. The only thing we can control is whether or not we *believe* we have free will. We can represent the possibilities as a matrix, with the human decision on the vertical axis and the pre-determined existence of free will on the horizontal:

Let us consider what happens in each of these scenarios.

In scenario A, a person believes they have free will. With this agency, they make decisions to better their life and the lives of those around them.

In scenario B, a person believes they have free will, when in fact they do not. However, *believing* that they have free will, they make decisions (or rather *think* that they make decisions) to better their life and the lives of those around them.

Here, we note a critical relationship: scenarios A and B have the **same** outcome. Regardless of whether or not free will truly exists, this person performed the exact same actions and had the same positive impact on the world.

Turning to scenario C, a person believes they do *not* have free will, even when they do. This person may make the same decisions as scenario A and improve the world around them. However, with their belief in determinism, they could also be less motivated to make a positive impact, especially when confronted with difficulty. Thus, we can say that the outcome of C is *worse than or equal to* the outcome of A. Believing in no free will cannot improve the impact one makes, but can worsen it.

Looking at scenario D, the logic from scenario C and the relationship between A and B both apply. The outcomes of C and D will be the same, and the outcome of D cannot be better than the outcome of B. I suppose there is the "bonus" of being correct about free will, but I am a firm believer that making positive contributions to society is far more important than being right.

Following the logic above, let x=outcome(A)=outcome(B) and y=outcome\(C\)=outcome(D), where x>=y. Then, we have value matrix:

Knowing that x>=y and that the only thing we can control is our *belief* about free will, the solution is obvious: regardless of whether or not we actually have free will, we should live our lives as if we do in order to achieve the best outcomes for ourselves and for society as a whole.

## Some questions are better left unanswered
Having established that it is in humanity's best interest to assume that we have free will, I argue that the debate on free will is not only unhelpful, but potentially harmful. If, one day, it is indeed proven that humans do not have free will, what will be the consequences on human behavior and on society at large? While I cannot predict the specific effects, the outcome will almost certainly be worse than if the question of free will had never been answered at all. This is an extension of the logic discussed above, where believing in free will yields outcomes *at least as good* as not believing. With everyone *forced* to believe that no free will exists as a fact, the overall outcomes worsen.

While I obviously cannot speak for every person out there, I believe that, in general, we want our lives to have meaning, our actions to have impact, and our choices to build towards a better world for ourselves and our children. If the free will debate is answered in favor of determinism, any illusion of this agency is shattered. There are better things to be than right... what are we willing to lose to be right about free will?
